# ReceptorSubstrate

This is a little Processing sketech that simulates a signal process in a cell. A receptor is a fixed point in space and if the diffusible substrate molecules hit them they're phosphorylated by the receptors. This is indicated by a brightness change. 

The sketch is just an exercise for me to wrap my head around the concept of biochemical simulation. There's alot more features to be implemented and stuff to be improved. I would be very happy of someone took the time and gave me some advice.

## To Do 
- Cleaner code design
- Plot the amount of phosphorylated substrate in an extra window
- Cellular compartiments
- Wiki: Theory of biochemical modeling
