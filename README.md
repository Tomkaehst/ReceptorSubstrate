# ReceptorSubstrate

This is a little Processing sketch that simulates a signal process in a cell. A receptor is a fixed point in space, and if the diffusible substrate molecules hit them they're phosphorylated by the receptors. A brightness change indicates this.

The sketch is just an exercise for me to wrap my head around the concept of biochemical simulation. There's a lot more features to be implemented and stuff to be improved. I would be very happy if someone took the time and gave me some advice.

## To Do 
-[] Cleaner code design
-[] Plot the amount of phosphorylated substrate in an extra window
-[] Cellular compartiments
-[] Wiki: Theory of biochemical modeling
-[] Inplement user interaction: Create new substrates, introduce other inhibitors, ...
